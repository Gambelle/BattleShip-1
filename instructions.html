        <div>
          <h4>Setup:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Pick the number of ships you would like to play with (1 to 6)</li>
            <li>Both Player1 and Player2 secretly place their ships</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>GamePlay:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Starting with Player1, each player guesses a board tile where they think their opponent may have put one of their ships</li>
            <li>Opponents rotate firing at each other's ships until one of the two player's ships are all sunk. The person who still has ships left is declared the winner.</li>
          </ol>
