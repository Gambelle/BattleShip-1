Unadjusted Function Point:
UFP = 33 + 44 + 00 + 44 + 55 = 9 + 16 + 0 + 16 + 25 = 66

Total Degree of Influence: measure of effects of 14 technical factors from 0-5
DI = 2 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 0 + 5 + 1 + 0 = 32

Technical Complexity Factor:
TCF = 0.65 + 0.01DI = 0.97

Function Point:
FP = UFPTCF = 660.97 = 64.02

Effort: FP times person-hour per funcion point
Effort = FPperson-hour/FP = 64.021 = 64.02

Total: 64.02 hours
